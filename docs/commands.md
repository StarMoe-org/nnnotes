# Commands

```
nnnotes [global options] <command> [command options]
```

Global options (before the command): `--config`, `--region`, `--language`, `--catalog`, `--catalog-release`, `--cache`, `--master`,
`--apk`, `--ffmpeg`, `--vgmstream`, `--node`, plus `--version` and `--help`. They set the settings
described in [configuration.md](configuration.md), which also lists the settings each command needs.
`nnnotes <command> --help` prints the options of a command. The asset export commands (`export`, `plan`,
`run-stage`, `catalogs`, `store`) are described in [assets.md](assets.md).

Commands that write files take the output path with `-o/--out` (required), except `web`, which takes the site
directory as its positional argument. JSON summaries on standard output are UTF-8. Every JSON file is written by one
writer: UTF-8, LF line endings, non-finite numbers as `1e999` / `-1e999` (a NaN is an error). The output is
deterministic for a given installation: the same inputs with the same versions of nnnotes, its Python dependencies
and the external tools give byte-identical files. Other versions can encode the same content into other bytes (a
PNG written by another Pillow version can differ in its bytes while its pixels are equal).

nnnotes sets `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1` unless the environment sets it: numpy's OpenBLAS otherwise starts one busy
thread per CPU in every process, and no command uses its parallelism.

A key, id or model the catalog or the master data does not have is a usage error: the command stops with exit
status 2 and a line naming it (`nnnotes <command>: error: ...`), before any bundle is fetched or file written.

## config

```
nnnotes config init [--user | --file F] [--set SECTION.KEY=VALUE ...] [--no-input] [--force]
nnnotes config set SECTION.KEY VALUE [--user | --file F]
nnnotes config unset SECTION.KEY [--user | --file F]
nnnotes config check [--json]
nnnotes config path [--json]
```

Write the config file from the template (asking in a terminal, else from `--set`), set or empty one value in place,
check every setting's origin and format, and list where the config file is looked up. No `config` command prints a
setting's value. Details in [configuration.md](configuration.md#writing-the-config-file).

## Cache

`pull` and every extractor read bundles through the cache (`[paths] cache`):

```
<cache>/catalog_main_<language>.bin     the legacy main catalog (explicit main or no API/version pin)
<cache>/bundles/<bundle file name>      bundles of the dependency closures, decrypted (UnityFS)
<cache>/raw/<path>                      raw CDN files stored as they are (e.g. CRI cue sheet data)
<cache>/catalogs/<region>/              catalogs downloaded by `browse`
<cache>/international/<CDN SHA256>/<resource version>/
                                       versioned catalog, bundles and raw files; isolated from old main caches
```

Files already in the cache are not downloaded again. When `[paths] apk` is set, the APK's own catalog is merged with
the region's and bundles that ship inside the APK are read from it.

For international regions with a configured API, catalog-based commands discover `resource_version` first and
download `catalog_<resource_version>_<language>.bin`. `catalogs fetch` labels the bytes with the version used to
select that file, rather than querying a newer label after downloading main. Use `--catalog-release VERSION` or
the [version settings](configuration.md) to pin builds and use cached data offline. An explicit `--catalog FILE`
bypasses discovery. JP keeps its existing Version-driven path.

## catalog

```
nnnotes catalog [--prefix PREFIX] [--limit LIMIT]
```

Prints the addressable keys that start with `PREFIX` (default: all), sorted, at most `LIMIT` (default 200), one per
line; the total count goes to standard error.

## browse

```
nnnotes browse [--port PORT] [--host HOST]
```

Serves a local web page on `HOST:PORT` (default `127.0.0.1:8000`) that lists every configured region, its catalog
languages, and per catalog the asset paths as directories. A link under an asset path downloads the bundle holding
it, decrypted; `bundles/<bundle key>` lists every bundle directly.

## pull

```
nnnotes pull KEY [KEY ...]
```

Fetches the bundle closure (the key's location and all its dependencies) of each key into the cache and prints the
cached path of every bundle.

## servers

```
nnnotes servers [--show-hosts]
```

Reads the server list from the bootstrap API root (`[bootstrap] api`) with an anonymous call to the game's API and
prints `{servers: [{name, displayName, areaId, region, cdnRoots, apiRoots}]}`: per server its name, its area id, the
configured region (`[servers.<region>]` table) whose `cdn` or `api` is one of the server's roots, or `null`, and how
many alternative CDN and API roots the server list gives. `--show-hosts` adds the roots themselves (`cdn`, `api`:
lists), ready for the `cdn` and `api` settings of a region. The exit status is 1 when the call fails.

## master version

```
nnnotes master version
```

Asks the region's API root (`[servers.<region>] api`) for the master data version and the resource version the
region serves now (the game's API, anonymous) and prints `{region, masterVersion, resourceVersion}`. The client
version sent with the call is `[client] version`, else the `versionName` of `[paths] apk`. The exit status is 1 when
the call fails.

## master decode

```
nnnotes master decode INPUT [INPUT ...] -o OUT [--workers N]
```

`INPUT`: master data files, or directories whose `*.bin` files are decoded. Each file (64-byte prefix, then
Rijndael-256 CBC with PKCS7 padding over gzip-compressed JSON) is written as `OUT/<file stem>.json` (UTF-8, one-space
indent, non-finite numbers as `1e999` / `-1e999`; a table with a NaN fails). `--workers` (default 8) decodes in parallel. Prints `{decoded, failed: [{file, error}], out}`; the exit
status is 1 when a file failed.

## master download

```
nnnotes master download (--version VERSION | --latest) -o OUT [--workers N]
```

Downloads master data version `VERSION`, or with `--latest` the version the region serves now (as
`master version`), from the region's CDN: `OUT/MasterManifest.json` and every `.bin` file it lists, each checked
against the manifest's SHA-256. Files already present with the right hash are kept.
`--workers` (default 16) downloads in parallel. Prints `{version, files, downloaded, kept, failed, out}`; the exit
status is 1 when a file failed or, with `--latest`, the version could not be fetched.

## adv

```
nnnotes adv ADV_ID -o OUT.json
```

One ADV episode as JSON: `advId`, `asset`, `commandCount`, `commands` (the episode's command list with the text,
sound and video rows resolved), `text` (every line in the five languages), `sounds`, `cuesheets`, `videos`,
`resources` (`kind`, `address`, `present` in the catalog), `master` (the `MasterAdv` row) and `title`.

`resources` lists the assets the game loads for the episode's command rows (rows marked `IgnoreData` load nothing;
cue sheets are in `cuesheets`): `live2d`, `stage`, `still`, `frame`, `effect`, `posteffect`, `timeline` and
`chatstamp` named by the row's asset name; `transition` for FadeIn / FadeOut rows (a row without a transition name
takes the player settings' default transition, which is read from `[paths] apk`); `talkwindow` for TalkWindow rows;
`chatwindow` and `chaticon` from the `MasterAdvChat` row of the chat rows' chat id; `video` from the episode's video
row of a Movie / Clip row's video id.

## story

```
nnnotes story ADV_ID -o OUT [--models MODELS] [--force] [--format flac|ogg|wav] [--flac-level N] [--no-audio]
              [--fonts open|game]
```

One ADV episode as a directory, and its Live2D models in a models directory:

```
MODELS/<id>/              every Live2D model of the episode (MODELS: `--models`, default OUT/../live2d), the files
                          of a site's model manifest (see `web`): model.json, moc3, prefab, the atlas pages and the
                          shader programs its drawables use
OUT/episode.json          as `adv`
OUT/audio/<cueSheet>/     every cue sheet of the episode, one file per cue + cues.json, streams.json
OUT/scene.json            player graphics, cameras, ADV fields, volumes, settings and stages
OUT/frames.json           Frame prefabs by asset name: uGUI, Animator controllers and clips, UI particle systems
OUT/effects.json          particle effect prefabs by asset name, `instances` (effect name -> asset name)
OUT/posteffects.json      PostEffect volume profiles by asset name
OUT/stills.json           Still prefabs by asset name
OUT/talkwindows.json      talk window prefabs of the TalkWindow rows
OUT/chat.json             chat window prefabs, icons and stamps (sprites), the MasterAdvChat rows, shared chat texts,
                          sounds and cue sheet rows
OUT/textures/, shaders/   textures and shaders of the scene and of the files above
OUT/videos/               Movie / Clip videos as WebM + videos.json (video id -> file, video row, size, frame rate)
OUT/ui/                   ADV UI: ui.json (front canvas, still / frame / video canvases and their camera, letterbox),
                          packed textures, UI shaders, rule transitions
OUT/crilips/              crilips.json + crilips.bin: the CRI Lips analysis data, when a voice reaches the analysis
OUT/story.json            index of the above (a file the episode does not need is null and not written)
```

story.json `models` maps the key of each model to its id (`<name>` of `Character/Live2D/<group>/<name>/model/<name>`)
and `modelsDir` is the path from OUT to MODELS. A model directory that exists is used as it is, so the stories of one
models directory export each model once; `--force` exports the episode's models again. The printed summary lists
the models exported (`modelsBuilt`) and those used as they were (`modelsSkipped`). Several `story` processes may
share a models directory: a model appears in it in one rename, whole, and a model two processes export at once is
kept from the first to finish (the other's export, the same bytes, is dropped and counted in `modelsSkipped`).

`--format` (default `flac`) is the audio format and `--flac-level` its FLAC compression level (as for `audio`);
`--no-audio` leaves the cue sheets undecoded (no `audio/`, `audio`
in story.json is empty). With audio, `crilips/` holds the weights of the game's CRI Lips mouth analysis, read from the
CRI Lips library in `[paths] apk` (or in the arm64-v8a split next to it, `split_config.arm64_v8a.apk`), when a voice
reaches that analysis: a lip-synced voice while a model has no MotionSync controller (model.json `motionSync`), or a
voice that other speakers follow (story.json `crilips`; ournotes-player docs/crilips.md). Videos keep the VP9 stream
of the game's USM file and carry its ADX audio as Opus (FFmpeg,
`[paths] ffmpeg`); the USM streams are unmasked with the CRI key read from `[paths] apk`. TextMesh Pro text in
frames, talk windows and chat keeps its layout and style; with `--fonts open` its font and sprite assets and text
materials are only named (no atlas is written), with `--fonts game` they are exported. The command stops before
writing anything when the episode uses resources that are not in the catalog or resource kinds that are not
supported (`timeline`). Prints the index with a summary.

The shared chat sound rows (`chat.json` `sounds`, `cueSheets`) name the cue sheet `AdvSe_Common`. In the version
1.0.1 data nothing holds it: no catalog language (`ja`, `en`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-Hans`, `ko`) has a key
`Cri/Sound/AdvSe_Common` or `EmbCri/Sound/AdvSe_Common` (remote or APK catalog), the APK has no ACB file of that
name, and it is not a Resources asset. The story therefore has no audio for these rows; the rows are kept as they
are. Every cue sheet of the episodes' own `-SoundCueSheet` shards has its `Cri/Sound/` key.

`ui/ui.json` holds the parts of the game's ADV widget the story draws: the front canvas (talk window, speaker plate,
location caption, title, rule transition, curtains, flash, subtitles caption, next indicator, menu entry button, menu
panel and video buttons, backlog, choices, tap areas), the canvases of stills, frames and videos with the screen
image and the camera they render with (`videoAndStillCamera`), the UI camera that renders the frame canvas
(`uiCamera`), and the letterbox bands; per node its transform, rect
and uGUI components, the views' serialized references as node paths (the menu view with its fast-forward sprites),
the other game components' serialized fields (`behaviours`), the widget's canvas sort orders (`widget`), the ADV
screen's dialogs (`dialogs`: the skip confirm and common dialog prefabs) and their texts of the language
(`masterIdTexts`), the chat phone (`chatWidget`), the text
records of the episode's chat windows (`chatTexts`) with their status texts (`chatStatusTexts`). The talk windows
sit under `TalkView`: the default window,
then each other window the episode's TalkWindow rows attach; when one of them dims and blurs the screen behind its
talk (`UICenterTalkWindow`), the front canvas' `CenterTalkBackdrop` node, the renderer's blur settings (`blur`) and
the blur shader come with it.

`ui/` follows the client language `[catalog] language` (`ja`, `en`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-Hans` or `ko`): the localized
fonts and materials, the line spacing LocalizeText applies, and, with `--fonts game`, the characters of the lines
(Talk, Location and Subtitles rows, ruby readings included), speaker names, title and UI texts in that language
(`ui/ui.json` `language`: `mode`, `field`, `lineSpacing`).

`--fonts` (default `open`) chooses how `ui/` handles text. Both modes write a text record `textStyle` for each text
node of `ui/ui.json`, and a document-level `textStyle` that holds the units and the line metrics of each font role.
With `open`, `ui/` contains no font data: no font atlases, glyph tables, font materials or text shader. `game` also
exports the game's TextMesh Pro fonts: per node the serialized text settings with the localized font and material
(`text`), and in the document the font assets reduced to the characters the episode shows (`fonts`), runtime glyphs,
text materials, `glyphCoverage`, `tmpSettings` and the text shader. `game` needs the optional `fonts` dependencies
(`pip install -e ".[fonts]"`).

The `ui/ui.json` text record (`textStyle` of a node; the node's `rect` and transform give its layout box):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `class`, `enabled` | TMP component class, enabled flag |
| `fontRole` | font slot of the game's localized fonts: `primary` (main text face), `number` (Latin / numeral face) |
| `materialType` | material style name of the text (`Default`, `OutlineAdvCommon`, ...) |
| `localized`, `textKey` | LocalizeText enabled; its master text id, or null when the runtime sets the text (talk, speaker, location and title texts come from `episode.json`, one field per language) |
| `text`, `richText`, `parseControlCharacters` | serialized text, rich text tags on, `\n`-style escapes parsed |
| `fontSize`, `autoSize` | size in canvas units; auto-size `enabled`, `min`, `max`, `maxCharWidthAdjust`, `maxLineSpacingAdjust` |
| `fontStyle`, `fontWeight` | style flags (`bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `strikethrough`, `lowerCase`, `upperCase`, `smallCaps`, `superscript`, `subscript`, `highlight`), weight 100-900 |
| `alignment` | `horizontal` (`left`, `center`, `right`, `justified`, `flush`, `geometry`), `vertical` (`top`, `middle`, `bottom`, `baseline`, `geometry`, `capline`) |
| `wrapping`, `overflow` | `noWrap` / `normal` / `preserveWhitespace` / `preserveWhitespaceNoWrap`; `overflow` / `ellipsis` / `masking` / `truncate` / `scrollRect` / `page` / `linked` |
| `margin` | `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom` insets of the rect |
| `lineSpacing` | `serialized`, `applied` (the value for the export language), `byLanguage` (the per-language line spacing LocalizeText applies; null when not localized) |
| `paragraphSpacing`, `characterSpacing`, `wordSpacing` | spacing in 1/100 em |
| `characterHorizontalScale`, `kerning`, `rightToLeft`, `orthographic` | as serialized |
| `color`, `colorMode`, `colorGradient`, `overrideHtmlColors` | vertex colour, gradient mode, four-corner gradient (null when off) |
| `face` | `color` (fill = `color` x `face.color`), `dilateEm`, `boldDilateEm` (glyph edge moved outwards), `softnessEm` (edge ramp width) |
| `outline` | null, or `color`, `widthEm` (band on each side of the glyph edge: stroke width 2 x `widthEm`, drawn over the fill), `softnessEm` |
| `underlay` | null, or `color`, `offsetEm` [x, y] (+x right, +y down), `dilateEm`, `softnessEm`, `inner` (shadow inside the glyph) |

`*Em` values are fractions of the drawn font size, converted from the text material's distance-field properties the
way the TMP shader applies them. The document-level `textStyle.roles` gives, per role, `lineHeightEm`, `ascentEm`,
`descentEm` (line pitch = `lineHeightEm` + `lineSpacing` / 100 em) and the font's `spacingOffset` / `boldSpacing`
(1/100 em) for the export language.

## live2d

```
nnnotes live2d MODEL -o OUT
```

A Live2D (Cubism) model prefab as a Cubism runtime directory. `MODEL` is the model's key
`Character/Live2D/<group>/<name>/model/<name>` or its id `<name>` (`nnnotes catalog --prefix Character/Live2D/` lists
the keys):

```
OUT/<name>.moc3                   the model's moc3
OUT/textures/*.png                atlas pages
OUT/<name>.prefab.json            the whole prefab: every GameObject and component, motions and expressions inlined
OUT/<exp>.exp3.json               expressions
OUT/<name>.physics3.json          physics (not written for a model without physics)
OUT/motions/<motion>.motion3.json motions (and motions/_fades.json)
OUT/<name>.model3.json            file references, EyeBlink / LipSync groups
```

Needs `[paths] apk` (component classes are resolved through the APK). Prints a JSON summary.

## spot

```
nnnotes spot SPOT_ID -o OUT
```

```
OUT/spot.json         master row, names, tap-talk episodes, situation settings, tap targets, Spine characters
OUT/spine/            Spine skeletons (.json or .skel), atlases, atlas page PNGs
OUT/room.glb          the spot's background as binary glTF (as `room`), with room.json
OUT/shaders/          shaders of the spot's bundles (as `shader`)
```

Needs `[paths] apk` and master data (`MasterHomeSpot`, `MasterText`, `MasterStoryHomeSpotTapTalkEpisode`). `room.glb` and
`room.json` are the `room` export of the spot's background.

A reference the situation prefab leaves empty is written as null: a Spine character with no `_animation` has null
`skeletonData`, `animation` and `world`, and a tap target with no `_focus` has a null `focusWorld`.

## room

```
nnnotes room KEY -o OUT.glb
```

A spot background prefab as binary glTF: every mesh baked into prefab space, converted to glTF's right-handed space,
textures embedded, materials translated from the shader's render state. Objects inactive in the prefab are kept with
`extras.unityActive = false`. A summary (`meshCount`, materials, textures, samplers) is written next to it as
`OUT.json`.

Materials and textures are told apart by serialized file and path id (the prefab's bundle and its dependencies can
reuse a path id). Each texture is one glTF texture with its own sampler, and textures whose PNG bytes are equal share
one glTF image. The summary's `textures` has one entry per glTF texture, in glTF order (the index a material's
`baseColorTexture` names): the Unity texture's name.

The render state is that of the shader's first pass for the material: blend factors (colour and alpha), blend
operations, colour mask, culling, depth write, depth test and alpha to mask. A state the shader takes from a
property (`Blend [_SrcBlend] [_DstBlend]`, `Cull [_Cull]`, `ZWrite [_ZWrite]`, ...) is the material's value of that
property, else the shader's default for it. Each glTF material keeps the resolved state in
`extras.unityRenderState` (and `OUT.json` in `materials[].renderState`); a shader or a state glTF cannot express
stops the command. A submesh whose material slot is empty is not written (there is no material to draw it with): the
summary lists each as `nullMaterialSubmeshes` (`mesh`, object `path` in the prefab, `submesh` index), and a mesh
left with no submesh is not written. A MeshFilter with no mesh, or a mesh with no triangles (no index data), draws
nothing and is not written; the summary lists the object path in `nullMeshFilters`, or the mesh and object path in
`meshesWithoutTriangles`.

## shader

```
nnnotes shader (--key KEY | --apk-bundle SUBSTRING [SUBSTRING ...]) -o OUT
```

Every Shader object in the bundle closure of `KEY`, or in the APK bundles whose file names contain the substrings
(each substring must match exactly one bundle; needs `[paths] apk`):

```
OUT/<name>.json                                    properties, subshaders, passes, render state, keywords
OUT/<name>/<platform>/s<S>p<P>_<stage>_<N>.<ext>   every compiled sub-program (GLSL ES as text, others as stored)
OUT/shaders.json                                   index with the keywords of every variant
```

## audio

```
nnnotes audio CUE_SHEET -o OUT [--format flac|ogg|wav] [--flac-level N]
```

Decodes the CRI cue sheet of the key `Cri/Sound/<CUE_SHEET>`: one file per stream (a name repeated within the
sheet gets `<name>_<stream>`), `cues.json` (first stream per name: file, sample rate, channels, samples, loop
points) and `streams.json` (every stream in order). `flac` (default) keeps the decoded PCM bit-exact; `ogg` is lossy.
`--flac-level` (0 to 12, default 8) is ffmpeg's FLAC compression level; every level decodes to the same samples.
The HCA keycode is read from `[paths] apk`.

## voices

```
nnnotes voices list [--from OUT] [--character C] [--category C] [--source S] [--episode ADV] [--status S]
                    [--limit N] [--json] [--language L]
nnnotes voices search TEXT [--from OUT] [--language L] [--character C] [--category C] [--source S]
                           [--episode ADV] [--status S] [--limit N] [--json]
nnnotes voices summary [--from OUT] [--json]
nnnotes voices get ID -o DIR [--from OUT] [--format flac|ogg|wav]
```

Queries the voices index ([views.md](views.md#voices)): the character voices the master data names and the voices
of the story episodes, with their source row, characters (for story voices, inferred from the speaker), category,
five-language text, cue sheet and cue. `--from OUT` reads `OUT/views/voices.json`, written by
`nnnotes export --views voices` (or `all`) with the exported audio and episodes (`--select key:Adv/Episode/`): then
every voice also has its status and the files of its streams. Without `--from` the index is built from the
configured master data and catalog: content and catalog keys only, every present voice `not-exported`; story
voices only for the episode of `--episode` (or of a `get` row id), read from the catalog.

- `--character`: a MasterCharacter id, or a part of a character's name in any language (full, short or English
  display name, case ignored). `--category`: a category (`CharacterRankUp`; case, `-` and `_` ignored, so
  `character-rank-up` works), `Source.Category` (`Story.Main`) or a source (`Talk`). `--source`: `Talk`,
  `CharacterVoice`, `MemberCard`, `LiveCharacter`, `LiveGekisouVoice`, `LiveDialogueCommon`,
  `LiveDialogueFixedPair`, `LiveStartCharacterVoice`, `HomeSpot`, `Title`, `Sound` or `Story`. `--episode`: the
  story voices of one episode, by MasterAdv id or episode asset. `--status`: a status of the index.
- `list` and `search` print one line per voice: id, characters (story voices: the speaker's name in `--language`),
  `Source.Category`, `sheet/cue`, status and the text in `--language` (default `[catalog] language`); `--json`
  prints the rows. `search TEXT` matches a part of the text in `--language` (every language when not given) or of
  the cue name, case ignored.
- `summary`: rows per status, per source and category and per character, the gaps (voices whose sheet has no key
  or whose decoded sheet lacks the cue, episodes without a key) and the unreferenced keys and streams; for the
  story episodes, their number per status and kind, the rows and inferred characters per speaker name, and the
  story voices whose cue a row of another source also names.
- `get ID`: `ID` is a row id (`MasterTalk:561`, `MasterAdv:<adv id>:<command index>`) or a sound id. Writes the
  files of the voice's streams into `DIR`, named as the export names them, and `voice.json` (its rows and files).
  With `--from` and the files exported, they are copied; otherwise the voice's cue sheet alone is decoded as
  `nnnotes audio` does (`--format`, FLAC level 8) and the cue's streams are picked by the ACB's cue table. Exit
  status 1 when the voice has no file (its status says why).

## crikey

```
nnnotes crikey [--write DIR]
```

Looks up the CRI HCA keycode in the APK's boot data and prints whether one was found (and its number of digits,
not its value). `--write` writes it as `DIR/.hcakey` (8 bytes, big-endian), the file vgmstream reads next to its
input; `DIR` is created when missing.

## player

```
nnnotes player -o OUT.json
```

The game's render settings from the APK's boot data as JSON: `colorSpace`, `defaultPipeline`, `qualityLevels`,
`qualityPerPlatform`, `pipelines`, `renderers`, `postProcessData`. Needs `[paths] apk`. The MonoBehaviours are read
with the type trees that ship with nnnotes; an APK whose classes do not match them stops the command with exit
status 2 and a line naming the class, the game version and the Unity version (as `story`, `live` and `web`).

## live

```
nnnotes live MUSIC_ID -o OUT [--difficulty easy|normal|hard|expert] [--format flac|ogg|wav]
                             [--flac-level N] [--fonts open|game] [--band BAND | --leader-card CARD_ID]
                             [--live-option OPTION[=VALUES] ...]
```

One chart (music + difficulty, default `expert`) as a self-contained directory, the format ournotes-player reads:

```
OUT/score/                   the chart as shipped, the converted runtime notes, master rows (title and band
                             names in every language), summary.json
OUT/audio/<cueSheet>/        the BGM cue sheet decoded per cue + cues.json, streams.json
OUT/audio/live-audio.json    the live's sounds (BGM, note SE, live SE: the start and finish cheers and the finish
                             sound of every result, all perfect, full combo, assist full combo and clear) with
                             their CRI routing; their cue sheets decoded next to the BGM
OUT/livescene/               scene graph, cameras, lane, background, start timeline, textures and shaders
OUT/livenotes/               note, line and effect prefabs, skins, clips, particle systems, textures and shaders
OUT/liveui/                  the start canvas in [catalog] language: strings, text records or fonts, sprites
OUT/live.json                index of the above
```

`--format` (default `flac`) is the format of every decoded cue sheet and `--flac-level` its FLAC compression level
(as for `audio`).

The start canvas follows the client language `[catalog] language` (`ja`, `en`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-Hans` or `ko`): its
text table column, fonts and line spacing. `--fonts open` (default) writes each text's layout and style (size,
alignment, wrapping, spacing, colours, outline / underlay from its material) and only the names of the game's fonts
and materials; `--fonts game` also writes the game's TextMesh Pro fonts reduced to the characters shown, with their
atlas textures (needs the optional `fonts` dependencies: `pip install 'nnnotes[fonts]'`).

The game takes the band of the background and start timeline from the player's deck centre. Without a deck the
band is `--band`, or the band of the character of `--leader-card` (a `MasterMemberCard` id), or by default the band
of the music's first vocal character; the choice is recorded in `livescene/scene.json`. Prints the index with a
summary.

The directory holds what a live reads with the game's default options (option preset 1 of a fresh profile).
`--live-option` (repeatable) adds the files of other values of the options that select files, so that a player can
offer them; the options are named as in the game (the names ournotes-player's settings use):

| `--live-option` | Adds |
|---|---|
| `MirrorChart` | `score/<chart>.mirror.notes.json`, the chart converted with lanes and flick directions mirrored (the game mirrors while it converts the chart); `live.json` `notesMirror` |
| `NoteDesignId` | the other note skins (`MasterLiveNoteSkin`): `livenotes/notes.json` `noteSkins` (skin asset name -> a record like `noteSkin`) and `settings.skins` (`NoteDesignId` -> skin asset name) |
| `NoteEffectId` | the other note effect sets (`MasterLiveNoteEffectSkin`; the lane effects are the same for every set): their assets in `livenotes/notes.json` `assets`, and `settings.effects` (`NoteEffectId` -> effect set name) |
| `LiveQuality` | the qualities of `MasterLiveQualitySettings`; at the Low quality (2) the game loads the `<name>Light` variant of a note effect set where the catalog has one (else the set itself), whose assets are added (and `settings.effects`) |
| `NoteSePatternId` | the other note sound sets (`MasterLiveNoteSe` groups): `audio/live-audio.json` `noteSe.groups` (set -> `LiveNoteSeType` -> sound id) and their sounds, decoded next to the others |
| `MeasureLineDisplay` | the bar lines: `livenotes/notes.json` `prefabs.bar_line_view`, the bar line view the live scene's bar line container instantiates (a node list like the note view prefabs), and its sprite's texture; the bar times and the BPM and time signature changes are in the score's notes (`barLineTimeMs`, `bpmChanges`, `barChanges`) with or without the option |
| `defaults` | only `settings.optionDefaults` / `optionRanges` of every option the player offers (note timing, the live and note sound volumes and mutes, the note sound set and per-type sounds, ...) |
| `all` | every option above with every value |

An option without values offers every value the master data has; `NAME=v,v,...` offers those values (the default
value is always included; a value the master data does not have is a usage error). Any option also writes the
`defaults` tables. Without `--live-option` the directory holds the files of the default options only.

Builds or updates a static [ournotes-player](https://github.com/empty-sekai/ournotes-player) site of charts, Live2D
models, stories or any of them:

```
SITE/index.html, chart-list.js ...        the player's chart list page; ?music=<id>&difficulty=<d> plays one chart
SITE/ournotes-player.element.min.js       the player's built bundle (and its source map)
SITE/charts.json                          chart index: listing facts (texts in every language), regions,
                                          manifest path, sizes
SITE/charts/<musicId>_<difficulty>.json   chart manifest: every path the player reads -> {asset, size[, stored]},
                                          or {parts: [[key, asset, size[, stored]], ...], size} for a large JSON
                                          object
SITE/charts/<region>/<id>.json            the manifest of a region whose chart files differ (see Regions)
SITE/models.json                          Live2D model index: id, key, group, canvas, manifest path, sizes; with
                                          master data the character and its names
SITE/models/<id>.json                     model manifest, the same entry forms as a chart manifest
SITE/live2d/                              the player's Live2D model page and its bundle (when the player has them)
SITE/stories.json                         story index: titles and story groups in every language, commands,
                                          languages, manifest path, sizes, regions
SITE/stories/<advId>.json                 story manifest: the common files and one file group per language, the
                                          same entry forms as a chart manifest; the model manifests of its models
                                          and the path to the site root
SITE/stories/<region>/<advId>.json        the manifest of a region whose story files differ (see Regions)
SITE/story/                               the player's story page and its bundle (when the player has them)
SITE/assets/<sha256>.<ext>[.gz|.br]       content-addressed files shared by all charts, models and stories
                                          (see --compress)
```

- `--pair` (repeatable; `<musicId>:<difficulty>` or `<musicId>_<difficulty>`) adds the given charts (a chart that
  no region of the site has a `MasterLiveMusicScore` row for is a usage error); `--all` adds every music and
  difficulty that has a `MasterLiveMusicScore` row (in the master data of any of the site's regions).
- `--live2d` (repeatable; a model id `<name>` or key `Character/Live2D/<group>/<name>/model/<name>`) adds the given
  Live2D models; `--all-live2d` adds every model key of the catalog. A model's id is its `<name>`. Its manifest lists
  the files the player's Live2D viewer and story page read: `model.json` (index: moc3, prefab, textures, shader index,
  the Cubism mask materials and `motionSync`, whether the prefab's root has the MotionSync controller with its CRI
  audio input), the moc3 and prefab as `live2d` writes them, the atlas pages the drawables use, and the GLSL ES 3.00
  programs of the Live2D shaders that the drawables' materials select, each keyword set also with
  `_ADDITIONAL_LIGHTS_VERTEX` (the story player adds it at quality 4), and the mask shader's for a model with masked
  drawables. Charts and models can be added in one run; models are built first.
- `--story` (repeatable; a `MasterAdv` id) adds the given story episodes (an id no region of the site has is a usage
  error); `--all-stories` adds every `MasterAdv` episode. See [Stories](#stories) below. Stories are built after
  models and charts; the Live2D models the stories to build use are built before them, as with `--live2d` (listed in
  `models.json`, names from the master data as for `--live2d`).
- A chart, model or story whose manifest exists is skipped unless `--force` (with stories, their models too). A
  model manifest whose `model.json` is of an older format (without `motionSync`) is outdated and built again; the
  summary lists such models in `modelsRebuilt` (`storyModels.modelsRebuilt` for the models of stories). Assets no
  chart, no model and no story (common or language file, or model manifest it names) references are removed.
- `--player-only` rewrites the player files, `charts.json`, `models.json` and `stories.json` only; `--reingest-json`
  stores every chart's and model's JSON files again from the site's own assets (then rewrites the player files and
  the indexes; story manifests are left as they are).
- `--player`: the ournotes-player checkout (after its build) or installed package; it must contain
  `scripts/read-set.mjs`, `dist/ournotes-player.element.min.js` and `examples/chart-list/index.html`. The read-set
  script runs under Node.js to list the files the player reads for each chart; only those are stored. When it also has
  `examples/live2d/index.html`, that page and `dist/ournotes-player.live2d.element.min.js` go to `SITE/live2d/`;
  when it has `examples/story-list/index.html` and `dist/ournotes-player.story.element.min.js`, they go to
  `SITE/story/` (a build that adds stories stops when the page is there without its bundle).
- `--compress` (default `gzip`): how the compressible assets are stored: JSON files (split parts included), GLSL,
  moc3, atlas, skel, bin, wav and glb files. With `gzip` or `br` (brotli, quality 11) such a file is stored encoded
  when that makes it smaller: `assets/<sha256>.<ext>.gz` (or `.br`), named by the SHA-256 of the decoded bytes; its
  entry's `size` is the decoded size and `stored` the size of the stored file (a part: `[key, asset, size, stored]`).
  Other files, and every file with `none`, are stored as they are, without `stored`. `--reingest-json` stores the
  JSON files again with the given `--compress`.
- Hosting: the player decodes a `.gz` or `.br` asset when the bytes it receives have the entry's `stored` length and
  uses them as they are when they have its `size`. A gzip site can be served as plain files; `Content-Encoding:
  gzip` on its `.gz` files is optional (with it the browser decodes them, without it the player does). A brotli site
  needs `Content-Encoding: br` on its `.br` files for Chromium-based browsers, which cannot decode brotli in the
  page.
- `--format` (default `aac`) is the BGM format of the charts and the format of every story sound (music, sound
  effects, voices); the charts' note SE, cheers and voices stay FLAC. `--no-audio` stores no audio (the player then
  runs the chart silent on its own clock, and plays stories without their sounds; story videos keep their sound
  track).
- `--workers`: parallel music processes (default a quarter of the CPUs, up to 8), model processes (default up
  to 4) and story processes (default a quarter of the CPUs, up to 8); `1` builds in this process. `--read-workers`: chart read sets run at a time, each a Node.js process
  (default half the CPUs, up to 16). With a player whose read-set script lists a chart's files from its plan
  (without stepping the chart) and serves many charts from one process, the plans run in one long-lived Node.js
  process per read-set slot, ended with the build; the full simulations that check a sample of the plans still run
  in a process each.
- `--tmp`: directory for the temporary live and model builds (default `SITE.tmp`); the build directories in it are
  removed after use. `SITE.tmp/cache/` is kept: decoded cue sheets, encoded PNGs, shader dumps and read sets, each
  stored under a hash of everything it was made from (input bytes, settings, the external tools and libraries in use
  and nnnotes' own code), so a later build with the same `--tmp` reuses what is unchanged and writes the same files
  faster. Deleting it is
  safe at any time outside a build; the next build then makes everything again.
- `--band` / `--leader-card`: as for `live`, for every chart. `--fonts`: for charts as for `live` (the site stores
  no start canvas files); for stories where the glyphs of the story text come from (see Stories).
- `--live-option` (repeatable): as for `live`, for the charts of this run (with `--pair` or `--all`). The live
  directories carry the variants' files, and a chart's read set is the union of its read set with the default
  options and its read sets with the settings of each offered variant (every combination of the offered mirror,
  note skin, effect set and quality values, the bar lines on, and each other note sound set; the player's read-set
  script needs its `--settings`); only the files a variant reads are stored, the shared ones once per site. A chart
  manifest lists the offered qualities as `options` (`{"LiveQuality": [0, 1, 2]}`); the other options are offered by
  the chart's files. Each variant adds a read-set plan per chart (`all` makes several dozen), so such a build takes
  longer. Charts whose manifest exists keep the options they were built with unless `--force`.
- Models need `[paths] apk` (component classes and the mask materials are read from the APK). Master data is
  optional: when it is configured (of the site's first region), each model that a `MasterCharacterCostume` row maps
  to a character (its `_live2dPath` is the key after `Character/Live2D/`) gets, in its manifest's `model` and its
  `models.json` entry, `character` (the `MasterCharacter` id), `names` (`{language: the character's name}`, from the
  `MasterText` row of `_nameTextID`, the languages that have a text) and `label` (the name in `[catalog] language`).
  A key the rows map to two characters gets none. The manifests of skipped models get this build's fields; without
  master data the fields are not written and skipped manifests keep theirs.
- `--region` (repeatable) / `--all-regions`: the regions the site serves (see Regions); default: the one
  `[catalog] region`. This `--region` follows the command name (`nnnotes web SITE --region tw --region kr`); the
  global `--region` before it sets `[catalog] region`.

### Stories

A story's manifest lists what the player's story page reads, in the layout of `story` (below the site's `assets/`):
`story.json`, `episode.json`, `scene.json`, the scene shaders (GLSL ES 3.00 programs only), textures, per cue sheet
`cues.json` and the file of each cue in the `--format` (an AAC file's encoder delay in
`cues.json` as `encoderDelay`), the media files the episode uses and its videos; per language (`--story-languages`,
default `ja,en,zh-Hant,zh-Hans,ko`) the story UI in that language (`ui/ui.json`), its font data (`ui/fonts.json` with
glyph pages under `ui/fonts/`) and `ui/languages.json`. UI files that are equal in every language are common files.
`scene.json` and `ui/ui.json` are stored split per top-level key, so the parts stories and languages share are stored
once. The Live2D models are the site's: the manifest names the model manifest of each model the story uses
(`models`, `{id: "models/<id>.json"}`, relative to the site root; `root` is the path from the manifest to the site
root), and `stories.json` counts their files in `size.models`. The format is described in the player's
`docs/story-data-format.md`.

- Story text is laid out with TextMeshPro's rules from TextMeshPro font assets holding exactly the characters the
  episode shows in the language (its text table, title and UI labels). `--fonts open` (default) generates them from
  a font file per language: `--font LANG=PATH` (repeatable) or `fonts.<lang>` in the `[paths]` table of the config
  file (`NNNOTES_PATHS_FONTS_<LANG>`, e.g. `NNNOTES_PATHS_FONTS_ZH_HANT`); every language of `--story-languages`
  needs one. Any OpenType or TrueType font (the first face of a collection) with the characters of the language
  works. The game's fallback chains are mirrored: where the game takes a character from a fallback font asset of
  another language's font (Korean text falls back to the Japanese font, for example), the generated asset falls
  back to an asset of that language's font file, which then needs to be given too (the build stops with the setting
  it needs when a character reaches it); characters no font file of the chain has are listed in `ui/fonts.json`
  `coverage.missing`. Characters the game's own font assets lack are drawn as the game draws them, as its missing
  glyph (U+25A1 where the game's font has it), not from the font file (`coverage.missingGlyph`). The simple talk
  window of an Overlay story is handled the same way. Each generated asset takes the
  point size, padding, style settings and render mode of the game font asset the texts use in that language, so the
  game's text materials apply unchanged; its face info and glyph metrics come from the font file (FreeType, no
  hinting), its distance field from the generator `--fonts game` uses for runtime glyphs (supersampled render modes
  at up to 8x). The asset records the font's family, version, license and SHA-256. `--fonts game` uses the game's
  font assets instead (the `fonts` extra); the format is the same. No font file is stored in the site other than as
  the generated glyph pages.
- Emoji are laid out as the game lays them out: its UI texts (the talk and chat texts) draw a character their font
  assets lack from the game's emoji sprite asset, and emoji sequences (several code points with U+200D or U+FE0F)
  become sprite tags through the game's emoji search. The layout keeps the game's sprite metrics; the images come
  from a colour emoji font of your own: `--font emoji=PATH` or `fonts.emoji` in the `[paths]` table
  (`NNNOTES_PATHS_FONTS_EMOJI`), a font with PNG bitmap glyphs (CBDT or sbix tables). Noto Color Emoji (SIL Open Font
  License 1.1) is the tested font. Only the sprites an episode's texts can draw are generated, each at the game's
  sprite size, into one page under `ui/fonts/`; `ui/fonts.json` records the emoji font as it records a text font.
  Without an emoji font the sprites keep their layout with empty glyphs, and `ui/fonts.json`
  `coverage.sprites.missing` lists them. `--fonts game` uses the game's sprite asset.
- Stories need `[paths] apk` and the optional `fonts` dependencies (`pip install 'nnnotes[fonts]'`) in both modes.
- The story index's groups come from the story tables of the master data (`MasterStoryEpisode` and its chapter,
  `MasterStoryFriendshipEpisode`, `MasterStoryHomeSpotTapTalkEpisode`, `MasterStoryLiveResultEpisode`,
  `MasterHomeSpot`), with chapter, character and spot names in every language.
- An Overlay episode (`MasterAdv._playbackMode` 1: the game plays it in its simple ADV player over the screen that
  opened it) is listed with `playbackMode` 1. With `--fonts open` its story also has the host screen (`host/`: the
  home spot or the live result screen of its story group) and, per language, the simple talk window
  (`ui/simple/ui.json`, `ui/simple/fonts.json` and its glyph pages); the manifest names them in `host`. The host has
  no game-font variant: with `--fonts game` an Overlay story has neither.
- With `--fonts open` the chat window texts of an episode with chat rows get their bindings in `ui/fonts.json`
  `chatTexts`, and the font assets also hold the chat windows' status texts and the texts they format at run time.
  The text nodes of the episode's frames get theirs in `frameTexts`, and the font assets also hold the texts a frame
  that receives texts is given at run time (the texts of its Frame rows' `TargetTextIDs`, as the frame formats them).
- Stories that fail are listed in the printed summary and in `SITE.story-failures.json`; the exit status is then 1.

### Regions and languages

One site serves several regions and every language:

- The regions serve the same catalog for a language, so a chart's files depend on the region's master data only.
  Regions whose chart tables (the master tables the chart build reads) are identical share one manifest,
  `charts/<id>.json`, built once from the first region's data. A region with other chart tables is built on its own
  into `charts/<region>/<id>.json`; such a manifest whose files equal the shared one's is dropped and the region joins
  the shared manifest. Models read no master data: one build serves every region. Stories follow the charts' rule
  with the master tables the story build reads (`stories/<id>.json`, `stories/<region>/<id>.json`); a region offers
  the stories of its `MasterAdv`.
- Each region's master data: `[servers.<region>] master` (else `[paths] master`, for at most one of the regions; the
  global `--master` flag is refused with more than one region). A region offers the charts its master data has a
  `MasterLiveMusicScore` row for.
- Chart files come from the catalog of `[catalog] language`; the listing texts come from the text tables in every
  language: a manifest's `chart` has `title` and `bands` in `[catalog] language` (`language`), and `titles` /
  `bandNames` in `ja`, `en`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-Hans` and `ko`. The manifest's `regions` lists the regions it serves;
  regions accumulate over builds (a skipped chart gains the regions of the build), so a region is dropped by building
  the site again from scratch.
- `charts.json` has one entry per manifest (an id appears once per region) with `regions`, `titles`, `bandNames`,
  and at the top `language` (the default listing language: `[catalog] language` of the latest build), `languages`
  and `regions` (`id`, `name` from `[servers.<region>] name`, `languages` from `[servers.<region>] languages`). The
  chart list page switches with `?region=<id>&lang=<language>`.

The same inputs with the same versions of nnnotes, its libraries and tools (and the same font files) give
byte-identical outputs; the encoded assets also need the same zlib and brotli versions. Charts that fail are listed
in the printed summary and in `SITE.failures.json`, models that fail in the summary and in
`SITE.model-failures.json`, stories in `SITE.story-failures.json`; the exit status is then 1.

## music-data

```
nnnotes music-data (--master-files DIR | --apk-master | --decoded-master) [--full] [--no-deck] [--seeds N]
                   [--workers N] [--no-gekisou-aptitude] [--aptitude-max-seeds N] [--aptitude-cross-seeds N]
                   [--stats-cache DIR] [--no-bgm] [--jackets DIR] -o FILE
```

Writes one JSON file with every `MasterLiveMusic` song and its charts for one master data version: titles, readings
and credits in the five text languages, bands (and a song's own band name), vocal characters, category, tags,
release time, jacket, Gekisou missions, score ranks, the whole `MasterLiveMusic` row, the live BGM's cue and length
(read from the cue sheet's ACB, without decoding audio); the Gekisou catalog (member cards and snaps with their
characters, bands and Gekisou skills and support skills: missions, highest levels, names and descriptions); per
difficulty the chart facts (level and display level, full combo count, note counts, BPM, note times, the live's music
length, skill event times, fever ranges) and the chart's deck statistics: the no-skill score and the weight of every
score-up skill kind at every performance position, with Gekisou on (a Gekisou live at rank 1, with what every other
rank and the Perfect play need) and off (a solo live), measured by the deck model ournotes-deck (built into nnnotes as
`nnnotes._deck`) on its whole-live simulation and checked against the chart facts and the master data. `--full` also writes the deck model's input: every
`MasterLiveMusicScore` row's chart as the client builds it at runtime (notes, skill events, fever ranges) and the
master data tables about cards, skills, bonuses, scores and events. Single-skill Gekisou aptitude is included by
default (not an optimal deck); `--no-gekisou-aptitude` omits it, `--aptitude-max-seeds N` (1024) and
`--aptitude-cross-seeds N` (64) cap its sampling and cross terms. `--no-deck` skips the deck model (every chart's
`deck` is null); `--seeds N` (default 8) and `--workers N` (default: every processor) set its seeds on charts with a
luck range and its threads. `--stats-cache DIR` keeps every chart's statistics in `DIR` under the SHA-256 of what
they are a function of (the deck model's sources, these options, the master data tables and the chart) and measures
only the charts it lacks; `DIR` then holds this file's charts only. The master data is decoded from the files as served: `--master-files DIR` reads
`DIR/MasterManifest.json` and the `.bin` files it lists (`master download`; the file's region is `[catalog] region`),
`--apk-master` the same files inside `[paths] apk` (region `embedded`); each file is checked against the manifest's
SHA-256. `--decoded-master` reads master data decoded elsewhere instead, without the master key: the `<Table>.json`
files of the master data directory (`[paths] master`, `--master`) and the `MasterManifest.json` of the files they were
decoded from, whose version and SHA-256 the file records (region `[catalog] region`). `--no-bgm` skips the cue sheets
(every `bgm.length` is null). `--jackets DIR` also writes every song's jacket as `DIR/<jacket>.webp` (at most 320 px
on the longer side). `FILE` ending in `.gz` is written gzip-compressed; the file is canonical: the same inputs and
nnnotes version give the same bytes. Prints `{out, format, region, masterSource, masterVersion, songs, charts, deck,
unplayable, full, bgm, jackets, bytes, fileBytes, sha256}`. A missing or unreadable input (a master data file, a
column, a text id, a chart asset, a cue sheet or cue, a jacket), a chart the deck model cannot measure, or deck
statistics that disagree with the chart facts stop the command with exit status 1 before the file is written. The
format is described in [music-data.md](music-data.md).
